The decompiled application of the mock exam system.

Target modifications include UAC, tempdir, deleting registry dependency (in order to be more mono-friendly) and so on.

A Keygen should also be made, although I am going to create a key-less version first.

This kind of modified app should also work with other similar apps. 

<hr />
Well, it seems that I should first consider building a KeyGen.

ILSpy didn't work so well...
